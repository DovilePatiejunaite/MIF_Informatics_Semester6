<P>There are many bibliographic sources available on the WWW, but the following 
I find indispensable. <A name=23231>&nbsp;</A> 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><EM>Computer Science Bibliographies</EM> - This is a collection of over 
  700,000 references to papers and technical reports in Computer Science, 
  beneath a sophisticated search engine. While there is much duplication, this 
  is my first stop whenever I need to look something up. The primary site is 
  http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/index.html, although several mirror 
  sites are in operation around the world. All references are provided in bibtex 
  format.
  <LI><EM>Joel Seiferas' paper.lst</EM> - References to over 55,000 papers and 
  technical reports (at last count), mostly on algorithms and related areas of 
  theoretical computer science. Each paper is reduced to a one-line format, 
  which I find easy to grep through. It is available by anonymous ftp from 
  ftp.cs.rochester.edu in /pub/u/joel, and a copy is included on the enclosed 
  CD-ROM. Strongly recommended.
  <LI><EM>Geom.bib</EM> - The <EM>complete</EM> bibliography on anything related 
  to computational geometry, it references over 8,000 books, papers, and reports 
  and includes detailed abstracts for many of them. Grep-ing through geom.bib is 
  an amazingly efficient way to find out about previous work without leaving 
  your office. It is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.usask.ca, in file 
  pub/geometry/geombib.tar.Z, and a copy is included on the enclosed CD-ROM. <A 
  name=23237>&nbsp;</A>
  <LI><EM>Usenet FAQ files</EM> - The straightest, most accurate dope about any 
  topic is likely to be had in a USENET frequently asked questions (FAQ) file. 
  Dedicated volunteers maintain FAQ files for many USENET newsgroups, many of 
  which are quite detailed, and which always emphasize other on-line resources. 
  Excellent FAQ files on algorithm-related topics such as cryptography, linear 
  programming, and data compression are currently available. A collection of 
  current FAQ files is maintained at ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers.
